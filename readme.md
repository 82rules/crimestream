# CrimeStream
This is the codebase for [tulsacrimestream.com](http://tulsacrimestream.com)

CrimeStream uses realtime data from Tulsa PD's [Live Calls](https://www.tulsapolice.org/live-calls-/police-calls-near-you.aspx) page, normalizes it, and overlays it on a Mapbox map of Tulsa using Leaflet JS.

# Contributing
I want this to be a useful and possibly fun app for people to use in conjunction with a police scanner, so contributions are encouraged!
